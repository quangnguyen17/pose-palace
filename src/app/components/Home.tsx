      <h4>How It Works</h4>
      <p>
        Our studio consists of two rooms: one features a cyclorama white wall, ideal for wide,
        full-body shots, while the other offers multiple colored backdrops, perfect for more
        personal waist-up or headshot portraits. An on-site attendant will guide you into either
        room, provide you with a remote clicker to trigger the camera shutter, assist you in taking
        your first shot to familiarize you with the equipment, and finally start the timer for your
        booked session.

      <h4>About Us</h4>
      <p>
        We are a proud Vietnamese-American-owned self-portrait photo studio conveniently located in
        Koreatown, Garden Grove. Our mission is to provide professional photos at affordable prices.
        You might wonder what a self-portrait studio is‚Äîessentially, it's a photography studio where
        customers take photos of themselves rather than being photographed by a professional.
        Equipped with a 32-inch monitor displaying the camera's live feed, you can see yourself
        exactly as you appear in the camera, much like looking into a mirror. We firmly believe that
        capturing memorable moments is invaluable. What better way to preserve these moments than by
        capturing them yourself, with your own authentic expressions and feelings?
