      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>
        Our studio consists of two rooms: one features a cyclorama white wall, ideal for wide,
        full-body shots, while the other offers multiple color backdrops, perfect for more personal
        waist-up to headshot portraits. An on-site attendant will guide you into either room,
        provide you with a remote clicker to trigger the camera shutter, assist you in taking your
        first shot to familiarize you with the equipment, and finally, start the timer for your
        booked session.

        We are a proud Vietnamese-American-owned self-portrait photo studio conveniently located in
        Koreatown, Garden Grove. Our mission is to provide professional photos at affordable prices.
        You might wonder what a self-portrait studio is. Essentially, it's a photography studio
        where customers take photos of themselves, rather than being photographed by a professional.
        Equipped with a 32-inch monitor displaying the camera's live feed, you can see yourself
        exactly as you appear in the camera, much like looking into a mirror. We firmly believe that
        capturing memorable moments is invaluable. What better way to preserve these moments than by
        capturing them yourself, with your own authentic expressions and feelings?
