          <h3>How it works</h3>
          <p>
            Our studio consists of two rooms: one features a cyclorama white wall, ideal for wide,
            full-body shots, while the other offers multiple color backdrops, perfect for more
            personal waist-up to headshot portraits. An on-site attendant will guide you into either
            room, provide you with a remote clicker to trigger the camera shutter, assist you in
            taking your first shot to familiarize you with the equipment, and finally, start the
            timer for your booked session.

          We are a proud Vietnamese-American-owned self-portrait photo studio conveniently located
          in Koreatown, Garden Grove. Our mission is to provide professional photos at affordable
          prices. You might wonder what a self-portrait studio is. Essentially, it's a photography
          studio where customers take photos of themselves, rather than being photographed by a
          professional. Equipped with a 32-inch monitor displaying the camera's live feed, you can
          see yourself exactly as you appear in the camera, much like looking into a mirror. We
          firmly believe that capturing memorable moments is invaluable. What better way to preserve
          these moments than by capturing them yourself, with your own authentic expressions and
          feelings?
