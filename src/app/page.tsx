            {`We are a proud Vietnamese-American-owned self-portrait photo studio conveniently located
            in Koreatown, Garden Grove. Our mission is to provide professional photos at affordable
            prices. You might wonder what a self-portrait studio is. Essentially, it's a photography
            studio where customers take photos of themselves, rather than being photographed by a
            professional. Equipped with a 32-inch monitor displaying the camera's live feed, you can
            see yourself exactly as you appear in the camera, much like looking into a mirror. We
            firmly believe that capturing memorable moments is invaluable. What better way to
            preserve these moments than by capturing them yourself, with your own authentic
            expressions and feelings?`}
          </p>
          <h3>How it works</h3>
          <p>
            {`Our studio consists of two rooms: one features a cyclorama white wall, ideal for wide,
            full-body shots, while the other offers multiple color backdrops, perfect for more
            personal waist-up to headshot portraits. An on-site attendant will guide you into either
            room, provide you with a remote clicker to trigger the camera shutter, assist you in
            taking your first shot to familiarize you with the equipment, and finally, start the
            timer for your booked session.`}
